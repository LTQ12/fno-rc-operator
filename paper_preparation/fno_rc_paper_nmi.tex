\begin{abstract}
Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) learn mappings between function spaces via spectral convolutions and have emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm for PDE modeling. However, multi-resolution generalization and long-horizon stability remain challenging under data scarcity. We introduce FNO-RC, a residual correction module driven by Continuous Fourier Transform (CFT) features. The correction acts in shallow spectral blocks, is time-aware yet spatially broadcast, and is regulated by a learnable scale with warmup and explicit temporal and high-frequency regularization. On challenging 3D Navier--Stokes settings with extremely long trajectories, FNO-RC substantially improves long-horizon rollouts and approaches (or matches) FNO under cross-resolution single-window tests. We provide a principled CFT formulation and spectral analyses to explain when and why residual correction helps.

\section{Introduction}
Neural operators learn mappings between function spaces and have emerged as a scalable paradigm for solving parametric PDEs \citep{kovachki2021neural, lu2021learning}. The Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) \citep{Li2020FNO} parameterizes integral kernels in the spectral domain and inverts via iFFT, providing strong accuracy--efficiency trade-offs and discretization-agnostic generalization. However, two practical challenges remain: (i) \textbf{cross-resolution shift}, where frequency distributions change under resampling and cause high-$k$ mismatch; (ii) \textbf{long-horizon rollouts}, where autoregressive predictions accumulate error due to small spectral biases.

We propose \textbf{FNO-RC}, a \emph{conservative residual correction} branch driven by \emph{continuous} Fourier features (CFT). The residual acts in shallow spectral blocks, is time-aware yet spatially broadcast, and is regulated by a learnable scale with warmup as well as explicit temporal and high-frequency regularization. Unlike replacing the discrete spectral path, our design augments the backbone with a principled continuous view that captures complementary spectra while preserving efficiency.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Method.} A CFT-driven residual correction for FNO, activated only in shallow blocks with a learnable scale and stability regularization.
  \item \textbf{Theory.} A practical CFT discretization via piecewise Chebyshev expansions \citep{barnett2010conformal}, clarifying when continuous features complement truncated discrete spectra.
  \item \textbf{Diagnostics.} Spectral tools (energy spectra, amplitude/phase errors) to analyze failure modes and validate stabilization.
  \item \textbf{Results.} Strong performance on challenging 3D Navier--Stokes with extremely long sequences; competitive cross-resolution generalization with RC disabled, and superior long-horizon rollouts with RC enabled.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Limitations of discrete spectral operators.} Discrete parameterization may suffer from aliasing under coarse sampling, implicit periodicity mismatch, truncated high-$k$ content, and cumulative bias in autoregression. Our residual is designed as a minimal and conservative fix that addresses these issues while maintaining the FNO backbone efficiency.

\section{Related Work}
\textbf{Neural operators.} Spectral and integral neural operators include FNO \citep{Li2020FNO}, low-rank spectral variants, attention-based AFNO, and U-Net-enhanced U-FNO. Physics-informed alternatives include DeepONet and PINO \citep{lu2021learning}. Spectral analysis is widely used to understand generalization and stability of PDE surrogates. We take a continuous-Fourier perspective and design a conservative residual that is only activated where necessary.

\section{Preliminaries and Method}
\subsection{Fourier Neural Operators}
Let $u\colon\Omega\subset\R^d\to\R$ denote a field. An FNO layer applies a truncated Fourier transform, multiplies by complex weights, and inverts:
\begin{align}
  \hat{u}(\xi) &= \F\{u\}(\xi) = \int_{\Omega} u(x)\,e^{-2\pi i\, x\cdot\xi}\,dx,\\
  v(x) &= \F^{-1}\{ W(\xi)\,\hat{u}(\xi) \}(x),\quad \xi\in\Xi_{\text{modes}},
\end{align}
where $W$ are learnable complex weights supported on a truncated set $\Xi_{\text{modes}}$. Stacking spectral layers with pointwise convolutions yields the FNO architecture \citep{Li2020FNO}.

\subsection{Continuous Fourier features (CFT) and discretization}
For $f\in L^1(\R^d)$, the continuous Fourier transform is
\begin{equation}
  (\F f)(\xi) \,=\, \int_{\R^d} f(x)\, e^{-2\pi i\, x\cdot\xi} \, dx,\qquad \xi\in\R^d.
\end{equation}
We employ CFT along spatial axes only (time is a parameter). Numerically, we approximate the integral via piecewise Chebyshev expansions on $L$ segments of order $M$, following high-accuracy quadrature for discontinuous Fourier integrals \citep{barnett2010conformal}. On a single axis $t\in[0,1]$ with segment $[t_\ell,t_{\ell+1}]$ and frequency $\omega$,
\begin{equation}
  \int_{t_\ell}^{t_{\ell+1}} f(t)\, e^{-2\pi i\, \omega t} dt \;\approx\; \sum_{m=0}^{M} c_{\ell m} \int_{-1}^{1} T_m(s)\, e^{-2\pi i\, \omega \, \phi_\ell(s)} \, \phi_\ell'(s)\, ds,
\end{equation}
where $T_m$ are Chebyshev polynomials and $\phi_\ell$ maps $[-1,1]$ onto $[t_\ell,t_{\ell+1}]$. The 2D CFT follows by separability across $x,y$.

\subsection{Residual correction design}
Given FNO features $X\in\R^{B\times C\times H\times W\times D}$, we compute spatial CFT features per time slice, project to a channel vector, broadcast over space, and add to the shallow FNO blocks:
\begin{align}
  C_t &= \text{CFT}_{x,y}(X_{:,:\,\cdot,\cdot, t})\in\C^{C\times K_x\times K_y},\\
  r_t &= g_\theta\big(\operatorname{ReIm}(C_t)\big) \in \R^{C_{\!out}},\quad t=1,\dots,D,\\
  R &= \mathrm{stack}(r_{1:D}) \in \R^{B\times C_{\!out}\times 1\times 1\times D},\\
  Y &= Y_{\text{FNO}} + \gamma\, R.
\end{align}
Here $g_\theta$ is a small MLP and $\gamma$ is a learnable scale per shallow block. We enable RC only in the first one or two spectral blocks.

\paragraph{Stabilization.} We use: (i) warmup schedule for $\gamma$; (ii) time-smoothing $\sum_t \lVert r_{t+1}-r_t\rVert_2^2$; (iii) high-frequency regularization that penalizes the residual energy in the top-$k$ band; (iv) multi-resolution augmentation via random spectral resampling of training windows.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\paragraph{Data.} 3D Navier--Stokes vorticity with $N=50$ trajectories, each of length $\sim10^4$. We construct windows with $T_{\text{in}}=10$, $T_{\text{out}}=20$. Training at $64\times 64$; testing includes cross-resolution at $96$ and $128$ with spectral or bilinear resampling.\footnote{Implementation follows our released scripts; single-GPU training uses TBPTT-style sequential blocks.}

\paragraph{Metrics.} We report relative L2 in raw physical space. For rollouts, we use autoregressive horizon $H=100$ with multi-step outputs per iteration (\texttt{step\_out} $\in\{5,10,20\}$).

\paragraph{Baselines.} FNO, FNO-RC (ours), U-FNO, LowRank-FNO, AFNO, and DeepONet-3D, all adapted to multi-step outputs and absolute-time channel.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Cross-resolution (single-window)}
Under spectral resampling, at $96\times 96$ FNO is strongest; FNO-RC backbone is close but below FNO. At $128\times 128$, the gap narrows. Bilinear resampling produces similar trends. We therefore adopt FNO-RC \emph{backbone} (RC disabled) as the default cross-resolution metric. See Fig.~\ref{fig:crossres}. Quantitative numbers (Raw L2, lower is better):

\end{table}

\subsection{Long-horizon rollouts}
With \texttt{step\_out}$=10$, FNO-RC significantly outperforms FNO at $96$ and $128$. With smaller \texttt{step\_out}$=5$, gains persist or increase. Frequent small corrections suppress error accumulation. See Fig.~\ref{fig:rollout}. Quantitative numbers (Raw L2, mean$\pm$std, $N=5$):

    $96\times96$, step\_out=10 & $1.0077\,\pm\,0.0682$ & $1.7865\,\pm\,0.0982$ \\
    $128\times128$, step\_out=10 & $1.0531\,\pm\,0.0260$ & $1.7863\,\pm\,0.0981$ \\
    $96\times96$, step\_out=5  & $\mathbf{0.9947}\,\pm\,0.0684$ & $1.1860\,\pm\,0.1011$ \\
    $128\times128$, step\_out=5 & $1.0026\,\pm\,0.0688$ & $1.1860\,\pm\,0.1012$ \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:rollout}
\end{table}

\subsection{Spectral diagnostics}
Energy spectra reveal FNO under-fits high-frequency energy, while naive RC may over-amplify it under resolution shift. For $96\times96$: high-$k$ energy (top-$\frac{1}{3}$) GT $2.75$, RC $7.77$, FNO $0.37$; amplitude relative error (mean$\pm$std) RC $4.53\pm4.29$, FNO $1.72\pm0.84$; phase absolute error (rad) RC $1.573\pm0.013$, FNO $1.558\pm0.019$. High-frequency regularization reduces RC overshoot without harming phase alignment. See Fig.~\ref{fig:spectrum}.

\section{Ablations}
We study (1) number of RC layers, (2) CFT sampling $(L,M)$, (3) initial $\gamma$ and warmup, (4) time-smoothing weight, (5) multi-resolution augmentation, and (6) high-frequency regularization weight and cutoff ratio. The most robust setting uses shallow RC, small $(L,M)$, small $\gamma$ with warmup, temporal smoothing, and modest HF regularization.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}
Residual correction improves \emph{temporal} stability but can be sensitive to \emph{cross-resolution} high-frequency distribution shift. Conservative use (shallow RC, small $\gamma$) and HF regularization mitigate this. Future work includes adaptive spectral gating and physics-informed constraints to further align high-$k$ behavior.
